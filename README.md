# Test Kairos


## Description
This app use Marvel api (https://developer.marvel.com)

For this test I have not used any external libraries, I am quite reluctant to use them, unless they are essential, I always try to analyze the pros and cons, I have always used unit tests before implementing the view, so I can test that the code works Before fighting with her, I understand that it can be improved, but being a test I consider that it is sufficiently successful.
 
Many more options can be implemented, it is a matter of spending time, I always try to make the code as clean as possible, avoiding the huge class, dividing the code and not creating very long functions or classes.

I have used an architecture that we can call MVVM, the reason for using this architecture is to be able to test the code, I would have liked to use SwiftUI for the visual part, together Combine but it was specified that it should not be used in this case.


## Requirements to compile

* Xcode 13+
* iOS 15+
